\title{Data generated from a mixture of three multivariate Normal distributions, 3 dimensions.
A dataset containing 150 observations generated from a mixture of three multivariate
Normal distributions. 50 observations come from a distribution with mean vector
(1, 3, 3), 50 observations come from a distribution with mean vector (4, 6, 0), and
50 observations come from a distribution with mean vector (2, 8, -3).
For each distribution, the variables each have unit variance and are uncorrelated.
The dataset is clusterable.}
\format{A data frame with 150 rows and 4 variables:

\describe{
   \item{x}{x variable}
   \item{y}{y variable}
   \item{z}{z variable}
   \item{cluster}{Distribution from which the observation was sampled}
}}
\usage{

\description{
Remove the cluster variable before using the dataset in any tests.
