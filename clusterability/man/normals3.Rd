\title{Data generated from a mixture of three multivariate Normal distributions, 2 dimensions.
A dataset containing 150 observations generated from a mixture of three multivariate
Normal distributions. 50 observations are from a distribution with mean vector
(3, 0), 50 observations from a distribution with mean vector (0, 3), and 50
observations from a distribution with mean vector (3, 6). For each of these three
distributions, the x and y variables have unit variance and are uncorrelated.
The dataset is clusterable.}
\format{A data frame with 150 rows and 3 variables:

\describe{
   \item{x}{x variable}
   \item{y}{y variable}
   \item{cluster}{Distribution from which the observation was sampled}
}}
\usage{

\description{
Remove the cluster variable before using the dataset in any tests.
