\title{Data generated from a single multivariate Normal distribution, 2 dimensions.}
\format{A data frame with 150 rows and 3 variables:

\describe{
   \item{x}{x variable}
   \item{y}{y variable}
   \item{cluster}{Distribution from which the observation was sampled}
}}
\usage{
normals1
}
\description{
A dataset containing 150 observations generated from a multivariate Normal
distribution. The distribution has mean vector (0, 4), each variable has unit
variance, and the variables are uncorrelated. This dataset is not clusterable.
}
\details{
The cluster variable is 1 for all observations because all were sampled from
the same distribution. Remove the variable before using the dataset in any
tests.
